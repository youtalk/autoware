# Deploy-time component-interface admission gate: the earliest point in the deploy pipeline where
# an interface mismatch across a composed image set can be caught, because it runs before any
# container in the set is created or started.
#
# Given a docker-compose file, resolve the image set it selects, then read each image's interface
# manifest(s) with NO container ever started (only `docker inspect` / `docker create` + `docker cp`
# against the image, so a binary-only third-party image works):
#
#   - Primary: the OCI label org.autoware.interface_manifest, read via `docker inspect`.
#   - Fallback: for an image with no such label, the interface_manifest_fragment.json file(s)
#     installed under /opt/autoware/share/<pkg>/ by every package that registers interfaces
#     through autoware_component_interface_utils. A container is created from the image to let
#     `docker cp` read its filesystem, but it is NEVER started -- the fallback is exactly as
#     boot-free as the label path.
#
# Either way, the SAME admission rule the runtime handshake uses (manifest_admit / evaluate_deploy)
# then runs over the whole set. A non-zero exit BLOCKS the deploy / OTA assembly BEFORE
# `docker compose up`.
#
# manifest_admit runs from a dedicated tool image (ADMIT_TOOL_IMAGE), NEVER from an image under
# test. That image's entrypoint must run manifest_admit with the ROS overlay sourced, taking the
# manifest JSON file paths as arguments and honouring manifest_admit's 0/1/2 exit-code contract
# (see docker/tools/test/admit-tool-entrypoint.sh for the reference tool image).
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy_check.sh <compose-file>
#   ADMIT_TOOL_IMAGE=my/admit-tool:tag ./deploy_check.sh <compose-file>
#
# Exit codes (mirrors manifest_admit):
#   0  every required interface is satisfied by a compatible provider
#   1  at least one admission rejection (MAJOR / MINOR / TOPIC mismatch, NO_PROVIDER, or a QoS
#      pivot / pairing violation)
#   2  operational error (`docker compose config` failed, no images, `docker inspect` failed, an
#      image has neither the label nor any installed manifest fragment, or the admission tool could
#      not be run)
